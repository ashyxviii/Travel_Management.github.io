Hello, I'm Asmita Kadam 👋
I am passionate about technology and problem-solving. Here's a glimpse of my work:

## 🛠 Project
OVERVIEW:

A Travel Management System (TMS) is a comprehensive platform designed to simplify and automate the process of planning, booking, and managing travel for individuals, groups, or organizations. It integrates various travel-related services like transportation (flights, buses, trains), accommodation (hotels, resorts), and activity booking into a unified system. With features like user registration, real-time availability checks, secure payment gateways, and automated invoicing, a TMS makes travel planning efficient and stress-free. Businesses often use these systems to manage corporate travel, ensuring cost control and compliance with travel policies, while individual users benefit from its ability to tailor recommendations based on preferences and budgets.

Technical Stack:

- Languages: C++, Java  
- *Algorithms: Dijkstra’s, A, KMP, Chain Hashing, Graph Traversal (DFS/BFS)
- Tools: Graphs, DAA Optimization Techniques  

Impact:

Modern TMS platforms also provide real-time updates on bookings, delays, or cancellations, and allow for easy modifications or cancellations with refund processing. Integrated customer support—via chatbots, live chat, or help desks—ensures user satisfaction. Administrators benefit from advanced analytics, vendor management tools, and detailed reporting for monitoring performance. By streamlining the entire travel process, TMS solutions save time, reduce errors, and offer a seamless experience, making them an essential tool for travel agencies, corporate offices, and independent travelers alike.
